Hi, I'm **Frederico Gago**, a software developer passionate about solving problems through clean, scalable, and efficient systems. I specialize in Python 3.13, Clean Architecture, SOLID principles, and layered design patterns that stand the test of complexity.

My mission is to improve the way people work—especially in fields like accounting and finance—by automating repetitive tasks and removing operational noise. I believe software should empower people to focus on what truly matters: thinking, analyzing, and making meaningful decisions.

This blog is where I document my learning process, share practical implementations, and reflect on challenges I face in real-world development. Whether it's refining backend services, crafting robust abstractions, or simplifying workflows, you’ll find honest, hands-on insights here.

Feel free to explore my [GitHub](https://github.com/fredericogago) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/frederico-gago-5849281aa).  
Let’s build software that makes work feel like progress.
